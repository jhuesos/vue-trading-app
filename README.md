> An excuse to apply what I have been learning about Vuejs.

This is the first iteration of the project, the idea is to continue iterating the project to improve it and add more
features. This is a non-ordered list of ideas I have that could be implemented :

- [ ] Create a Nodejs backend to store stock information and provide values.
- [ ] Add authentication.
- [ ] Provide real time stats using Websockets
- [ ] Add charts to see how values evolve
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] E2E tests.
- [ ] Use Service Workers
- [ ] Make it a Progressive Web app

**Important: ** Since this is a experimental app, I am going to only support Modern Browsers, that means
pretty much everything except IE11. I understand the importance of not leaving anyone behind, but this is not a
production app.

If by any chance, someome was to open issues with suggestions, you are more than welcome. I know there are things
that can be improved, but I am trying to don't fall into the *perfection trap* and never finish anything.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
